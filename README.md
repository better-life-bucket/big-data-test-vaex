# big-data-test-vaex
This is a simple test project to validade vaex lib performance.

vaex_random_generator.py is set to generate a bunch of hdf5 files in "files/vx_files". So create this path, otherwise code will break.

big_vaex.py is set to read all hdf5 files in path "files/vx_files" print their shapes and concatenate them together.
